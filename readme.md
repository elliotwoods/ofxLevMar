#ofxLevMar

wrap up LevMar from http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/
GPL

## Prerequisites
Current we require ofxPolyFit (for the dataset structures, which are mighty fine i might add). Likely this extension will merge with ofxPolyfit to make ofxNumericalFit (or something like that).

## Usage
You need to:

1. Link liblevmar.a to your project (this repo includes the i386 symbols for osx).
2. Include levmar.h
