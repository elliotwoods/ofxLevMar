#ofxLevMar

wrap up LevMar from http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/
GPL

## Prerequisites
Current we require ofxPolyFit (for the dataset structures, which are mighty fine i might add). Likely this extension will merge with ofxPolyfit to make ofxNumericalFit (or something like that).

## Usage
Include all the files in your project except for the *_code.c files (these are dealt with like h files, so you just need them in your include path, you dont want to compile them directly)
